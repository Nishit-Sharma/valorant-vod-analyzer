# VOD-Net: Large-Scale Valorant Analysis Engine

VOD-Net is an ambitious open-source project to build a large-scale data processing pipeline for Valorant gameplay analysis. It moves beyond single-video analysis to ingest and process thousands of hours of gameplay, creating a rich, queryable database of in-game events, player movements, and strategic patterns. This data powers a web-based recommendation engine that provides players with data-driven strategic advice.

## Project Vision & Goals

The core vision is to transform noisy, unstructured video data into structured, strategic insights at scale.

1.  **Build a Distributed Data Pipeline:** Create a robust and scalable pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze thousands of gameplay videos concurrently.
2.  **Develop Advanced Computer Vision Models:** Go beyond simple minimap tracking to extract a wide array of game-state information (e.g., ability usage, kill events, player health, ammo) directly from the player's main view.
3.  **Create a Queryable Strategic Database:** Store the extracted data in a database optimized for spatio-temporal queries, allowing for complex questions about game states.
4.  **Deliver Data-Driven Recommendations:** Build a web interface where users can query the database for strategic recommendations based on specific in-game scenarios.

## High-Level Architecture

VOD-Net is composed of four main systems:


1.  **The Ingestion & Processing Pipeline (The "ETL" Layer):**
    *   **Video Source:** Ingests VODs from various sources (e.g., local files, YouTube links).
    *   **Task Queue:** Manages the queue of videos to be processed.
    *   **Distributed Workers:** A pool of workers that execute the video analysis tasks in parallel. Each worker runs the core CV model.
    *   **Core CV Model:** A sophisticated model (e.g., fine-tuned YOLOv8 or a custom architecture) that processes video frames to extract game events.

2.  **The Strategic Database (The "Storage" Layer):**
    *   **Event Storage:** Stores discrete game events like kills, ability usage, and bomb plants.
    *   **Positional Storage:** Stores time-series data of player positions.
    *   **Data Schema:** A carefully designed schema to allow for efficient querying of complex game states.

3.  **The Recommendation Engine (The "Query" Layer):**
    *   **Backend API:** An API that translates user queries into database lookups.
    -   **Similarity Search:** Finds past games in the database that match a user-provided scenario.
    *   **Synthesis Logic:** Aggregates data from similar past games to generate heatmaps, statistical summaries, and actionable advice.

4.  **The Web Interface (The "Presentation" Layer):**
    *   **Frontend Application:** A user-friendly web app (built in Next.js) where users can submit scenarios and view the strategic recommendations.
    *   **Visualization Tools:** Renders heatmaps, timelines, and statistical charts to present the insights clearly.

## Proposed Tech Stack

*   **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
*   **Frameworks:**
    *   **CV & Pipeline:** OpenCV, PyTorch, Python's `concurrent.futures` (for distributed processing)
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI
    *   **Frontend:** Next.js
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS (for structured data and spatial queries), and potentially a vector database like Weaviate for similarity search.
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS/GCP for deployment.

## Project Roadmap

This project will be developed in phases:

*   **Phase 1: Core CV Model Development.**
    *   Goal: Develop a Python script that can take a single video file and output a structured JSON file of all game events.
    *   Tasks: Data collection and annotation, model selection (fine-tuning YOLO), implementation of event extraction logic.

*   **Phase 2: Database and API.**
    *   Goal: Design the database schema and build a backend API to insert and query the data from Phase 1.
    *   Tasks: Set up PostgreSQL, design tables, build FastAPI endpoints for `POST /v1/game` and `GET /v1/strategy`.

*   **Phase 3: The Data Pipeline.**
    *   Goal: Scale the system to process multiple videos in parallel.
    *   Tasks: Integrate Python's `concurrent.futures` to distribute the CV processing tasks from Phase 1 across multiple workers.

*   **Phase 4: Frontend and Recommendation Engine.**
    *   Goal: Build the user-facing web application.
    *   Tasks: Develop the Next.js frontend, implement the query logic to the backend, and create compelling data visualizations.
